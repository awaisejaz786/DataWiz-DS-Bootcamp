        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between the `/` and the `//` operators?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *`/` divides the two integers or float values `//` gives you a round value  after division* \n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is the difference between the `*` and the `**` operators?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** `*` *multiplies two numbers and `**` gives square or power of that number* \n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the order of precedence for arithmetic operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *All the operators have left-to-right associativity.*\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How do you specify the order in which arithmetic operations are performed in an expression involving multiple operators?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *Parenthesis are performed First then, Exponentiation is performed  (when available), multiplication and division are performed next, addition and subtraction are performed last.*\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How do you solve a multi-step arithmetic word problem using Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.**\n",
        "13. What are variables? Why are they useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.*** Recall that a variable is a label for a location in memory. It can be used to hold a value. In statically typed languages, variables have predetermined types, and a variable can only be used to hold values of that type. In Python, we may reuse the same variable to store values of any type.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How do you create a variable in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Python lets you create variables simply by assigning a value to the variable, without the need to declare the variable upfront. The value assigned to a variable determines the variable type.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the assignment operator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables.\n",
        "16. What are the rules for naming a variable in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.*** Rules for Python variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n",
        "*   A variable name cannot start with a number\n",
        "*   A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",
        "*   Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)\n",
        "\n",
        "17. How do you view the value of a variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.***Variables may be shown on the screen using the print() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. How do you store the result of an arithmetic expression in a variable?\n",
        "**Ans.*** *a=1+2*\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What happens if you try to access a variable that has not been defined?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *Attempting to access a variable that hasn't previously been defined raises a NameError exception*\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How do you display messages in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *Python print() can be used to show a message in the Python*\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What types of inputs can the print function accept?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *It accepts list, tuple, int and all other data types*\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What are code comments? How are they useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *A comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.*\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the different ways of creating comments in Python code?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *In Python, there are two ways to annotate your code. The first is to include comments that detail or indicate what a section of code – or snippet – does. The second makes use of multi-line comments or paragraphs that serve as documentation for others reading your code.*\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What are the different comparison operations supported in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *(> , < , >= , <= , = , =!)*\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the result of a comparison operation?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *True and False*\n",
        "\n",
        "26. What is the difference between `=` and `==` in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *The Equality operator `==` compares the values of both the operands and checks for value equality. and `=` is used to assign value to a variable.*\n",
        "\n",
        "27. What are the logical operators supported in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *AND, OR , NOT*\n",
        "\n",
        "28. What is the difference between the `and` and `or` operators?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *When we use AND to combine two or more than two conditions, records satisfying all the specified conditions will be there in the result.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*But in case of OR operator, atleast one condition from the conditions specified must be satisfied by any record to be in the resultset.*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "29. Can you use comparison and logical operators in the same expression?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *Yes we can*\n",
        "\n",
        "30. What is the purpose of using parentheses in arithmetic or logical expressions?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** *Parentheses are used to control the order in which operators are evaluated.*\n"
